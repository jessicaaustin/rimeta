Congratulations! You are the happy owner of a brand new robot! 

Your first step will be to create an odometry module. Your robot has
differential steering, and an encoder on each wheel. Based on these 
encoder readings, you can use a dead-reckoning algorithm to estimate
your current pose (position and orientation).

For a very simple dead-reckoning algorithm, see Section 1.3.1 (pg 19-20)
of "Where Am I? - Systems and Methods for Mobile Robot Positioning", 
available at http://www-personal.umich.edu/~johannb/Papers/pos96rep.pdf
and also in this folder. 

Please see the diagram.png image for the coordinate system.

Your robot has a wheel radius of 20 cm, and an axle length of 18 cm.
Your wheel encoders have 512 clicks per revolution.
